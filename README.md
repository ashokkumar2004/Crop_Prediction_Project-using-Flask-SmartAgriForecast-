# Crop Prediction Project using Machine Learning

This repository contains a crop prediction project implemented using a Decision Tree Classifier. The machine learning model predicts suitable crops for cultivation based on various parameters. Additionally, a web application is implemented in Flask, providing an easy-to-use interface for agriculturists to predict the most suitable crop for cultivation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to assist agriculturists in making informed decisions about which crops to cultivate based on specific factors. The Decision Tree Classifier is employed to analyze various input parameters and provide accurate predictions. The Flask web application acts as a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input relevant data and receive crop recommendations.
